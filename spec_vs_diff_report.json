  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-16 by modifying App.tsx to add a 5-second loading timeout guard that prevents indefinite spinner states, and by refactoring GamePlay.tsx to use prop-based navigation with local balance state and non-blocking backend recording. GameGrid.tsx is also updated to call navigateTo with the full game name. The core requirement of fixing the loading/spinner issue is addressed, with fallback logic and a deterministic timeout implemented.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "All 6 games (Dragon vs Tiger, 7 Up Down, Andar Bahar, Ludo, Mines, Crash) are individually tested and render correctly.",
      "reason": "The diff shows structural fixes to GamePlay.tsx and App.tsx but there is no evidence of test coverage or verification that all 6 individual game UIs render correctly. No test files are added or modified.",

      "reason": "The build request specifies fixing the loading issue in GamePlay.tsx specifically. The timeout guard was added to App.tsx's overall loading state which is a broader scope than what was strictly requested, though it does support the requirement indirectly.",
