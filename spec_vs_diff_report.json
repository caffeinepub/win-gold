  "summary": "The diff shows that LoginSignup.tsx was modified to implement a 4-step flow including an OTP step with a simulated 6-digit OTP displayed in a styled gold info box, a 3-attempt limit, 5-minute expiry, and a Resend OTP option. The file summary description aligns well with all REQ-14 acceptance criteria. However, since only a summary of the file is provided (not the actual code diff), some implementation details cannot be fully verified.",
