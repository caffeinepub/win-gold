# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the app title and displayed name to "YONO DAN" throughout the frontend.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the `<title>` tag in `frontend/index.html` to "YONO DAN"
- Update the app name/branding in the header and login/signup screen to display "YONO DAN"

**User-visible outcome:** The browser tab and all branding areas in the app (header, login screen) now show "YONO DAN" as the app name.
