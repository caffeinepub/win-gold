      "id": "REQ-16",
      "summary": "Fix the game loading issue in GamePlay.tsx where game screens get stuck on a loading/spinner state and never render the actual game UI. Remove or resolve any blocking async calls, actor initialization guards, or conditional rendering logic that prevents the game view from appearing.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Tapping any of the 6 game cards on the Home screen navigates to that game's play screen without getting stuck on a loading spinner.",
        "The game play UI (bet selection, game board/controls, Play button) is fully visible and interactive within 2 seconds of navigation.",
        "If the backend actor is unavailable or slow to initialize, the game still renders using local/fallback logic — no indefinite loading state.",
        "All 6 games (Dragon vs Tiger, 7 Up Down, Andar Bahar, Ludo, Mines, Crash) are individually tested and render correctly.",
        "No unhandled promise rejections or console errors related to actor initialization block the game render.",
        "The back/close button on the game screen correctly returns the user to the Home screen."

          "description": "Remove or refactor any conditional rendering logic that blocks the game UI when the actor is loading or unavailable. Ensure the game UI (bet selection panel, game board, Play button) renders immediately regardless of actor state. If actor operations (balance fetch, game recording) fail or are pending, show the game UI anyway and handle errors gracefully with toast notifications or inline error messages. Eliminate any spinner/loading state that prevents the user from seeing the game interface. Verify that all six games (Dragon vs Tiger, 7 Up Down, Andar Bahar, Ludo, Mines, Crash) render their play screens correctly without hanging on a loading spinner."
