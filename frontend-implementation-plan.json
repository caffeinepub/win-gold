      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "After entering a valid mobile number and tapping Continue, a 6-digit OTP is generated and displayed on screen in a styled info box.",
        "An OTP input field is shown for the user to type the received code.",
        "The OTP and its 5-minute expiry are stored only in React component state — no backend calls for OTP.",
        "If the entered OTP matches the generated one, the flow proceeds to name entry (new user) or home (returning user).",
        "If the OTP is wrong, a clear error message is shown below the input.",
        "After 3 failed attempts, the OTP is invalidated and the user is asked to restart the flow.",
        "After a successful OTP match, the OTP is immediately invalidated so it cannot be reused."

All OTP logic remains client-side only in React state—no backend persistence."
