    {
      "id": "REQ-16",
      "text": "Fix the game loading issue in GamePlay.tsx where game screens get stuck on a loading/spinner state and never render the actual game UI. Remove or resolve any blocking async calls, actor initialization guards, or conditional rendering logic that prevents the game view from appearing. Ensure that tapping any game card from GameGrid correctly navigates to and fully renders the corresponding game play screen (Dragon vs Tiger, 7 Up Down, Andar Bahar, Ludo, Mines, Crash) without hanging. The game UI must render immediately (or within a short deterministic timeout) regardless of actor/backend availability — fall back to local game logic if the actor is not yet initialized rather than staying on a spinner indefinitely.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Tapping any of the 6 game cards on the Home screen navigates to that game's play screen without getting stuck on a loading spinner.",
        "The game play UI (bet selection, game board/controls, Play button) is fully visible and interactive within 2 seconds of navigation.",
        "If the backend actor is unavailable or slow to initialize, the game still renders using local/fallback logic — no indefinite loading state.",
        "All 6 games (Dragon vs Tiger, 7 Up Down, Andar Bahar, Ludo, Mines, Crash) are individually tested and render correctly.",
        "No unhandled promise rejections or console errors related to actor initialization block the game render.",
        "The back/close button on the game screen correctly returns the user to the Home screen."

    "Changing the visual theme or game card designs.",
