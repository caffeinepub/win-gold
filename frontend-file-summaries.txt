  "frontend/src/components/LoginSignup.tsx": "Login/signup component with a 4-step flow (auth → mobile → otp → name). After entering a mobile number, a simulated 6-digit OTP is generated and displayed on-screen in a styled gold info box; the user must enter it correctly to proceed (with 3-attempt limit, 5-minute expiry, and a Resend OTP option), after which the existing login/register backend calls execute as before.",
  "frontend/src/pages/GamePlay.tsx": "Full game play page accepting `gameName`, `user`, `onBack`, and `onBalanceUpdate` props (prop-based navigation, no router hooks). Renders game image, bet selector, choice selector, result display, play button with loading state, and game rules; uses local balance state synced from user prop with non-blocking best-effort backend recording.",
  "frontend/src/components/GameGrid.tsx": "Game grid component accepting a `navigateTo` prop, displaying all 6 games (Dragon vs Tiger, 7 Up Down, Andar Bahar, Ludo, Mines, Crash) in two sections with images, badges, player counts, and Play Now buttons that call `navigateTo('game', gameName)` using the full game name as the identifier.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main app component managing authentication, page routing, and user state. Now includes a 5-second loading timeout guard so that if actor initialization or profile checking takes too long, the app stops blocking on the loading spinner and proceeds to show the login/game UI instead of hanging indefinitely."
