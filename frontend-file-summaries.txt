After entering a mobile number, a simulated 6-digit OTP is generated and displayed on-screen in a styled gold info box; the user must enter it correctly to proceed (with 3-attempt limit, 5-minute expiry, and a Resend OTP option), after which the existing login/register backend calls execute as before."
